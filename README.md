# ViaEcole Internship project

## Technologies

- Laravel - Backend framework
- MySQL
- React - Frontend framework
- Pusher - Websockets framework for realtime chat


This project was created by me and my classmate [Felix](https://github.com/Rockyfelle) as a prototype platform for how realtime communication could be implemented in ViaEcoles existing platform.

We used Laravel passport for authentication and middleware to control routes and restrict access for functionalities such as adding / removing students and chat-channels and uploading files.
